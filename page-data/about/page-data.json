Non-uniform icons, too much content, too much images/gifs distracts visitors to see your actual work.</p>\n<p>To solve this, GitHub Profile README Generator came into existence.</p>\n<p>So many developers contributed to the project and made it more awesome to use. You can contribute too to make it grow even further.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<a href=\"https://github.com/khanhduy1407/gh-profile-generator/issues\" target=\"blank\">\n<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/khanhduy1407/gh-profile-generator?style=flat-square\" alt=\"gh-profile-generator issues\"/>\n</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/khanhduy1407/gh-profile-generator/pulls\" target=\"blank\">\n<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr/khanhduy1407/gh-profile-generator?style=flat-square\" alt=\"gh-profile-generator pull-requests\"/>\n</a>\n</p>\n<h3>Contributors üôè</h3>\n<p>List of the developers who contributed to the project. A big shout out for them.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/khanhduy1407/gh-profile-generator/graphs/contributors\">\n<img src=\"https://contributors-img.web.app/image?repo=khanhduy1407/gh-profile-generator\" />\n</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>How do I create a profile README?</h2>\n<p>The profile README is created by creating a new repository that‚Äôs the same name as your username. For example, my GitHub username is <strong>khanhduy1407</strong> so I created a new repository with the name <strong>khanhduy1407</strong>. Note: at the time of this writing, in order to access the profile README feature, the letter-casing must match your GitHub username.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new repository with the same name (including casing) as your GitHub username: <a href=\"https://github.com/new\">https://github.com/new</a></li>\n<li>Create a README.md file inside the new repo with content (text, GIFs, images, emojis, etc.)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commit your fancy new README!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're on GitHub's web interface you can choose to commit directly to the repo's main branch (i.e., master or main) which will make it immediately visible on your profile)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Push changes to GitHub (if you made changes locally i.e., on your computer and not github.com)</p>\n<hr/>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to use?</h2>\n<p>Tired of editing profile README(.md) to add new features like visitors-count badge, github-stats etc?</p>\n<p>Don't worry. Keep calm, fill the form and let the tool do the work for you</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Why visitors count keeps on increasing?</h2>\n<p>So many users raised an issue that the counter keeps on increasing everytime the page reloads.</p>\n<p>Well it is visitors count not \"unique\" visitors count. The goal of the addon is to provide a good stat of how well the github profile is doing.</p>\n<p>Proper use or misuse of the addon is the sole responsibility of the user. The developer of the addon is working on it to fix this issue.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 04, 2019","slug":"/about","title":"üë®‚Äçüíª About"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
